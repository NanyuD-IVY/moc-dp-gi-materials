Chapters 8 and 9 cover propositional and predicate logic.  Chapters 1-3 cover sets, functions and relations, and Chapter 4 induction.

>[SetsLogicAndMathsForComputing.pdf](https://github.com/NanyuD-IVY/moc-dp-gi-materials/blob/main/moc/SetsLogicAndMathsForComputing.pdf)

Gives an introduction to Haskell and covers recursion, induction, propositional and predicate logic, sets, relations and functions in a Haskell context.

>[DiscreteMathematicsUsingAComputer.pdf](https://github.com/NanyuD-IVY/moc-dp-gi-materials/blob/main/moc/DiscreteMathematicsUsingAComputer.pdf)

Covers regular and context-free languages, and computability.

>[AConciseIntroductionToLanguage.pdf](https://github.com/NanyuD-IVY/moc-dp-gi-materials/blob/main/moc/AConciseIntroductionToLanguage.pdf)

Covers regular and context-free languages, Turing machines, computability and decidability.  Also has a chapter on complexity theory. Much of the content is outside the scope of COMP30026, but worth reading if you are interested.
